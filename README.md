## Introduction

Welcome to the Tic-Tac-Toe game in Python! This project allows you to create a simple command-line version of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game. You can implement player vs. player gameplay or even challenge yourself by creating an AI opponent. This README.md file will guide you through setting up, playing, and extending the game.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following:

- Python 3.x installed on your computer.
- A code editor of your choice (e.g., Visual Studio Code, PyCharm, or a simple text editor).

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/tic-tac-toe.git
Change your current directory to the project folder:

bash
Copy code
cd tic-tac-toe
Run the game:

bash
Copy code
python tic_tac_toe.py
Now you're ready to play Tic-Tac-Toe!

Game Rules
Tic-Tac-Toe is a two-player game, typically played on a 3x3 grid. The goal is to be the first to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of your symbol (either "X" or "O"). Here are the basic rules:

The game starts with an empty 3x3 grid.
Player 1 (X) goes first, and then players take turns.
Each player places their symbol on an empty cell of the grid.
The game continues until one player wins or there are no empty cells left (a draw).
A player wins if they have three of their symbols in a row, column, or diagonal.
Project Structure
tic_tac_toe.py: The main Python script containing the game logic.
README.md: This documentation file.
LICENSE: The license file for this project (replace with your preferred license).
Feel free to organize your project structure as you see fit.

How to Play
Start the game by running the tic_tac_toe.py script.
You'll see an empty 3x3 grid, and Player 1 (X) will be prompted to make their move.
Players take turns by entering the row and column where they want to place their symbol.
The game continues until a player wins or it's a draw.
Here's a simple example of how a move is made:

scss
Copy code
Player 1 (X), enter your move (row and column): 1 2
This will place an "X" on the first row, second column.

Extending the Game
This project is a great starting point for expanding your Python skills. Here are some ideas for extending the game:

AI Opponent: Create an AI opponent using algorithms like the Minimax algorithm to make the computer unbeatable.

Graphical User Interface (GUI): Use a library like Pygame or Tkinter to create a graphical interface for the game with images and sound effects.

Custom Board Size: Allow players to choose a custom board size, not limited to 3x3.

Player vs. Player Over Network: Implement a networked version of the game, allowing players to play against each other online.

Statistics and Leaderboards: Keep track of game statistics, including wins, losses, and draws. Implement leaderboards.

Themes and Customization: Let players choose different themes or customize their symbols.

Remember that as you add more features, the complexity of the code will increase. Take it one step at a time and enjoy the learning process!
